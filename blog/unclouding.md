# Unclouding Cloud Computing Technology

Ten years back, when I got my first hand-me-down phone from my brother, I used it carefully so as not to exhaust the 8GB storage it had. System apps took most of the space, meaning I could keep installed a maximum of only three games at a time(temple run and subway surfers were greedy as hell while 2048 was a sweetheart). Fast forward to today, I have a pretty decent phone with a 64GB storage capacity but still keep running out of space. I manage to store all my files and apps by keeping multiple email ids and using gdrive, one drive and other "free" cloud storage platforms.<!--truncate-->
Due to the ever advancing technology, cameras got better and media quality improved resulting in increased space consumption. Not just that, technology has become a humongous part of our lives, making it impossible to survive without certain apps and software that additionally, contribute to grabbing up phone space.
Yet, we live peacefully with no worries about running out of digital space. We use it somehow like how we carelessly use water. The only difference is that water is expensive to recycle and reuse but cloud storage spaces are easy to free up and reuse.

If the physical storage space burden was so heavy on personal mobile phones, imagine how hard it would have been for businesses? Businesses maintain huge databases and have millions of people accessing their services at an instant. If each company had to physically arrange their own storage space, it would be very costly and inconvenient. This is where cloud computing comes into play.

Cloud computing is on-demand access, via the internet, to computing resources—applications, servers (physical servers and virtual servers), data storage, development tools, networking capabilities, and more—hosted at a remote data centre managed by a cloud services provider (or CSP). The CSP makes these resources available for a monthly subscription fee or bills them according to usage.
This technology has removed a huge burden from businesses allowing them to scale easily and adapt to emerging technology efficiently.
There are several cloud computing service providing platforms, the most popular being Amazon Web Services(AWS). Here’s how McDonald’s used AWS to scale its business.

To adapt to the growing use of technology, Mcdonald's had to sharpen its digital services. More than a million orders are placed at once, and McDonalds was required to handle all these requests, process them, store them, etc. McDonalds integrated with Amazon Web services to make this comfortable and more efficient. They used auto-scaling services from AWS and configured server space such that it always accommodates a certain number of orders per mili or microsecond. This way, they didn’t have to worry about running out of server space or having unused server space. It was less expensive too. Using AWS they were able to prioritize tasks and also isolate containers. Multiple security options which came with frequent updations were also provided. All this helped them keep an interactive interface and provide foolproof services, cost-effectively.

Cloud computing services have become an essential part of our everyday lives. Every major business up to date uses these services. It’s cheaper, more efficient and the go-to option for anyone looking for server space. But that’s not it, cloud computing not only offers storage space but several features that come along with it, which can help manage and grow your business comfortably. Cloud computing has huge potential in the business sector, from the scalability point of view and efficient technology management. You wouldn't have to worry about advancing technology, services would take care of them all and keep your technology updated.

The cloud computing sector is forever advancing. The security offered and speed of accessing has become far better than its predecessors and shall continue improving. Cloud computing has huge potential in the future. As more and more corporations grow dependent on cloud services, more innovation tends to take place. New applications and software would become hardware agnostic and the use of low-cost hardware will see a boost. Upgrading and replacements of essential computing elements will become more effortless as the whole infrastructure will be disintegrated into its basic components. It is predicted that in the forthcoming years, cloud service providers will be one of the fastest-growing market sectors.
