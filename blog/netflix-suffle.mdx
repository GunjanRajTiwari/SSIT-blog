### Hello World!

The year 2020 has been a bit chaotic. If you look at it on the surface level, it kind of sucks, but if you look deep enough, well, it still sucks. There has been one mishap after another. Natural disasters, almost a world war, the pandemic and the list just keeps going on.

In the midst of all this, there is one other issue that has been tormenting the lives of the youth of this country, nay, the youth of the entire world. The dilemma of choosing what to binge next!

It’s been 8 months of staying inside the 4 walls of our own rooms, with countless sessions of binge watching TV shows, animes and movies. Sooner or later we all were bound to run out of things to watch, but what now? Do we just keep on googling aimlessly, searching for a stone that we are yet to turn?

No, because once again from the ashes of dismay, our hero NETFLIX like a phoenix, rises and comes to our rescue. From creating a platform with a mind-numbing amount of content to go through, to giving us a button that lets us skip the intro of every show with just a single click. Once again, Netflix gives us another tool to make our lives easier.

## THE NETFLIX SHUFFLE BUTTON!

:::info So, what is _“the Netflix shuffle button”_ and how does it work?

Well, it’s simply what the name suggests. A shuffle button on Netflix. When a user hits the shuffle button they'll be shown movies or TV shows similar to something they’ve already watched, a movie or TV show they're already watching, or something saved on your Netflix's My List.
:::

The button will appear in three places, once under each profile on the home screen, again on the menu while a user is browsing within their respective profile, and finally on the TV menu screen.

The shuffle button is an effort by the company to make the user experience more comfortable, to help members of the Netflix community find content tailored to their tastes quickly and easily.

Having a feature such as this will definitely be amazing and very helpful, but of course, at the end of the day the experience will vary from user to user. A random movie generator, no matter what complex algorithm it uses might not be able to satisfy the user at every point, at times you are bound to get disappointed, while on the contrary it might even surprise you with the suggestions it makes. At the end, in my opinion it can either be a bliss, freeing you from the suffering of searching for a show or a movie or a curse that will trap you in an endless paradox of binge watching one program after another.

At last all I would like to say is that, _“A cruise that frees you from the shackles of an aimless journey might as well be a bliss wrapped in darkness”_.
