> _“I m bored in the house and I m in the house bored…”_

Deathbed by powfu ,Supalonely by benee these are some of those songs which are associated with the brand name _“Tik tok”_. There is a whole playlist in spotify where u can browse these songs. And they are hitting the top in various global lists as well as our own playlist .According to a study a human adult aged approximately _“millennial”_ to _“boomer”_ is quite known about the app tik tok. Millions of people just dance up a storm in these highly addictive songs which have just blown everyone’s mind .<!--truncate--> So its quite obvious everyone was hit when the ban of Tik tok was declared all over the world.

If we check out the stats TikTok is already banned in India, where it was downloaded more than 118 million times in 2020. The U.S. ban has cut into a significant amount of the user growth it has seen this year.More than 50 million U.S. users downloaded the app in 2020, per AppTopia.The company although says that TikTok has more than 100 million American users.

## The big picture:

As Axios has previously noted, more than any other Chinese-owned app, TikTok has found success outside of its homeland. But an increasing number of countries are beginning to eye bans of the app.Japan is also mulling a ban of TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps. As TechCrunch notes, Japan was one of TikTok's first oversees success stories. Pakistan has put TikTok on notice for featuring what the government calls inappropriate content. Pakistan issued a "final warning" to TikTok in late July. Hong Kong passed a sweeping security law earlier this year that caused TikTok to discontinue operating there. Indonesia, one of TikTok's more popular markets, temporarily banned the app in 2018 for _"inappropriate content"_.The ban was quickly overturned once the company agreed to censor _“negative content”_ per Reuters.

For some countries ,the ban was necessary to some extent as for them it created or violated their ethics and culture but in some cases the reasons were worse. There were various allegations of illegal content such as pornography and blasphemy by the governments of the respective countries. However the platform had made movements to align with the governments in these countries . In Egypt, five women were sentenced to two years in prison over TikTok videos on charges of violating public morals. If we talk about India , India's government claims these apps are using data illegally, and secretly collecting information from people's phones when they download the apps. It says its letting its citizens using these apps is a threat to India's national security. After the ban was announced, the head of TikTok in India, Nikhil Gandhi, released another statement challenging the Indian government's accusation of TikTok misusing data.

> _“TikTok continues to comply with all data privacy and security requirements under Indian law and has not shared any information of our users in India with any foreign government, including the Chinese government,"_ he said.

Stars of the platform who are based in India have now been forced to stop using the app . Many creators are supportive of India's decision, but some are asking for India to release alternative apps that they could use.

At last if we talk about the effects after the ban. When President Donald Trump announced an executive order banning Americans from making transactions with TikTok parent company Byte Dance, many creators on the platform were worried about what that would mean for them. If the ban comes into effect it could stop Americans from using the platform, which has grown rapidly over the past few months. For most people, the ban on TikTok didn’t have a major impact on their lives or would put an end to a fun app they use to kill time. But for some, like the biggest creators on TikTok, this had an impact on their entire livelihood. Therefore most probably these tik tok stars have to now rely on other platforms which work similar to this app or social media as well.
