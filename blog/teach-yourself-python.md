## How to teach yourself python? The right way.

**Python** may be a high level, interpreted, object-oriented blah… blah... programming language but I see it as a toy, children programmers are crazy about. Yes, it has easy syntax and pretty easy to learn but if learned the correct way. So ....

<!--truncate-->

I see people trying to learn not only python but any programming stuffs going through tutorials over tutorials, books over books and some are even joining Universities and going to college everyday (including me) ending up unsatisfied. I have seen no one satisfied with these materials from by birth till now. Then what is the problem?

## The Problem

People hear about python, hear about average salary of a python developer, get fascinated and start learning it. They don’t know actually why they are learning it. All these people complain about the same thing. Although they are going through dozens of tutorials, they got stuck at the same point. They are unable to take a step forward. They learn basics from a tutorial and go to another one hoping to learn something new but they learn nothing much. But they don’t give up watching more. (Why?)

## The Actual Problem

Those tutorials are not the problem, the main problem is the fear(seriously?yes) and lack of self confidence and motivation within you. All these tutorials teach you basic concept and hello world stuffs nothing more. Yes, there are tutorials for advanced stuffs. Python has a very good documentation as well. But you don’t know what next. Nobody tells you, none of these tutorials teaches you what to learn next. They don’t dig path for you. To make a right path, either you should have a destination or you should be a civil engineer.

Don’t worry if you aren’t both. If you have a destination, I mean if you know why you are learning it you can easily make a learning path but I know you don’t. I am not an astrologer but if you had one you wouldn’t have read up to here. And you are afraid to dig a path, you are afraid to teach yourself, and you keep learning the same thing without improvement. You cannot hit a basket in basketball just by going through a tutorial saying you have to hit at an angle of 45 degree with your hand at 90 degree and all these bullshits. People even watch the whole video due to fear of missing something. (This fear Holy Jesus). They write small programs using the basics but when it comes to writing some hundred lines of code they say,” Oh! I am not ready for that; I have to learn more for that.” This is the actual problem.

## The Solution

The only way you can teach yourself python is by doing first and then learning. You should cut off that fear and start doing. Learning must be full of experiments. You should dive into the pool of knowledge and experiment or search for methods which will help you float.
Every programmer has to pass through three stages and most of them get stuck in the first one. I will tell you what to do in each one so that you can move ahead easily. This is the way you can teach yourself python the right way.

### Initial Stage:

In this stage, you are damn excited to learn. You can learn basics from anywhere; a simple book or www.w3schools.com or a simple YouTube video can be enough. Then just dive into problems. Think of different problems like problems of mathematics and small logical problems and make idea in mind how to solve. If you are poor at that, then just go to www.hackerrank.com or you can google search problems. Remember, problems are everywhere. Then, search for the syntax you don’t know how to do.

You will get your answer in w3schools at first. Then you start getting answers at stack overflow which means you have improved. Even the best programmer in the world googles but your google and YouTube searches should be very specific like” How to loop through two loops at once” not “python loops” and if your search is like,” Learn everything in python” believe me you are gonna stay years in initial stage.

### Intermediate Stage:

In this stage, fear has its maximum effect. In the initial stage you will do may mini projects like rock paper scissor, calculator, etc. But companies prefer a good single project rather than hundreds of mini projects. Now you have to start working on projects. Don’t think you are not ready; if you think, you are gone. You should jump into and start a project with whatever you know. Just think of a project or you can start by cloning an existing project. Make coding your daily habit and commit to your code every day. Think of the features and search for “how to add … feature” and learn as you go.

Once you complete your first few projects, you will be in right track. You can now assume well, where the destination is and you will be able to make your path yourself. Learn new frameworks and make a project on it. This way you start remembering stuffs as well. Make a bunch of projects and skills and you are ready to go to next level.

### Final Stage:

Now you are already a good programmer. I have to tell you nothing if you reach this stage. I can only give some suggestion. Make a strong resume and try making a good portfolio website and showcase your major projects. Apply for internships and work even if the salary is too low. This will put an experience section in your resume. Interact with community actively. You can even start your own company with some ambitious people. There are tons of freelancing sites you can start freelancing. This way you get to know properly the world of programming.
I don’t know if it is the best way to learn python but I can definitely say it is a right way.
